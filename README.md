# Spider
I always liked the classic Spider Game, that Microsoft shipped with Windows ultil Windows 7. Then with Windows 10 they decided to rewrite it inserting a lot of crap and unskippable ads. So I decided to create my own open source version of the game. 


### Usage
In the `jar` directory you can find the jar file of the game, simply download it and double click on it to run the game. Java 8 is required.

To build the project from source, use IntelliJ Idea.
